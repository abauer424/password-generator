# Password Generator

## Description 

For the password generator project our task was to incorporate javascript to make the function work and user interactive. I started off by reading the assignment and creating pseudocode for each line of the acceptance criteria. 

In this project, I started off by creating the function and used an alert to display information to the user on what is the minimum and maximum character count. I then used if statements to ensure the user input met the alert qualifications. Next I alerted the user asking if they would like to include special, numerical, lowercase or uppercase characters. Based on the user input, I made the password generate the criteria to match.

If you do not enter a number between 8-128, you will be alerted to enter a number between 8-128. If you entered a number between 8-128 you will go on to the next screen which will ask if you would like special, numerical, lowercase or uppercase characters in your password.
